Puppet Module for Android SDK
=============================

This Puppet module is used to install the Android SDK, 
along with platforms and other add-ons.

Supported platforms:

* Linux (RedHat, Debian families)
* Mac OS X

Examples
--------

To install the Android SDK in the default location (/usr/local/android on both Linux
and Mac OS X) you simply include the android class like so.

```
  include android
```

You can also change the default parameters like so:

```
  class { 'android':
    user       => 'someuser',
    group      => 'somegroup',
    installdir => '/path/to/your/dir',
  }
```

To install an android platform, do it like so:

```
  android::platform { 'android-16': }
```

You can also install add-ons:

```
  android::addon { 'addon-google_apis-google-16': }
```

Or extra's:

```
  android::extra { 'extra-google-play_billing' }
```

Tip: to get the appropriate name of the add-ons/extras run the following command:

```
/usr/local/android/android-sdk-macosx/tools/android list sdk -u --all --extended|grep " or "
```
